# Theater Play Outcomes in Relation to their Launch Dates and Funding Goals

## Overview of Project

### Louise’s play, Fever, came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. She wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. I used the Kickstarter dataset to analyze and visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. The following will be my analysis of how different the outcomes in relation to launch date and my analysis of how different the outcomes in relation to their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### The above graph provides information about theater outcomes in relation to the launch date. Based upon the above graph, after May, the number of successful events gradually decreased for the rest of the year.  

### Also from the above graph, the number of failed events gradually increased from January until May. Between May and August, the number of events remained similiar. There is a spike in the number of failed events in October. The amount of canceled events remained very low throughout the year.

### The above graph provides percent information about play outcomes based upon is pledged goal raised amount in dollars. The percent of successful theater plays changed over time. There is a negative trend from less that $1000 between $24,999. There was a positive trend between $25000 and $44,999. After $45,000, the percent of successful events drop rapidly. The percent of failed events had the inverse information from the successful events.     

### How the graph is currently depicted, it is hard to compare positive and negative events without switching the data and graph to percentages when looking month to month. This information gives trend analysis of events that took place in a month. 

## Results

- May held largest difference between the most successful theater events compared to May failed theater events. Therefore, May would be the best time to launch a theater event. 

- The lowest difference in successful and failed theater events was held in December. Both successful and failed events were close to equal which would mean that a theater event held in December would have close to a 50% chance of success.

- The percentage of successful events has a better likelyhood if the pledged goal amount was less than $14,999 or had a pledged goal of $35,000 to $44,999.

- The dataset is great to identify successful and failed events, but it is difficult to make inferences about determining a successful event based on the launch date and pledge goal. For this information, we need more data about the successful and failed events: how did they raised the money for pledges, what external factors that helped meet goal pledged, was there a guest speaker or did they have recruitment? Can they hold a satisfaction surveys? With information like this, we could start making better inferences about what time of year to launch a theater event and how much to set the goal amount to for a theater play. Additionally, we should also find out how much more money each event had pledged higher than the goal as higher amounts probably meant that the event had a high chance of success. 

- We should create another graph that is the percentages of theater outcomes based on launch date to help determine the time frame of launching a theater event. We should also create another graph of how much the more the pledged amount vs the goal effected the event of a success or failure.
