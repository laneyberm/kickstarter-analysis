# Theater Play Outcomes in Relation to their Launch Dates and Funding Goals

## Overview of Project

### Louise’s play, Fever, came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. She wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. I used the Kickstarter dataset to analyze and visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. The following will be my analysis of how different the outcomes in relation to launch date and my analysis of how different the outcomes in relation to their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

![Theater Outcomes vs Launch Dates](/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

### The above graph provides information about theater outcomes in relation to the launch date. Based upon the above graph, successful events increased from January until it's peak in May. After May, the successful events decreased gradually for the rest of the year.  

### Also from the above graph, failed events gradually increased from January until May. Between May and August, the events remained similiar. There is a spike of failed events in October. The amount of canceled events remained very low throughout the year. Additionally, there were no canceled events in October.

### The above graph provides information about play outcomes based upon is pledged goal raised amount in dollars. Based upon the above graph, the percent of successful events gradually drecreased until the goal amount was $25,000. The percent of successful events increased from $25,000 to $44,999. After $45,000, the percent of successful events drop rapidly. The percent of failed events had the inverse information from the successful events.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered, Challenges or difficulties that were encountered, and how they were overcome, are well explained. If there were no difficulties, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered

## Results

- May held largest difference between the most successful theater events compared to May failed theater events. Therefore, May would be the best time to launch a theater event. 

- The lowest difference in successful and failed theater events was held in December. Both successful and failed events were close to equal which would mean that a theater event held in December would have close to a 50% chance of success.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset? There is a summary of the limitations of the dataset.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? Is there a recommendation for additional tables or graphs?
