# Theater Play Outcomes in Relation to their Launch Dates and Funding Goals

## Overview of Project

### Louise’s play, Fever, came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. She wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. I used the Kickstarter dataset to analyze and visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. The following will be my analysis of how different the outcomes in relation to launch date and my analysis of how different the outcomes in relation to their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### The above graph provides information about theater outcomes based upon it launch date. Based on the above graph, successful events increased from January until it's peak in May. After May, the successful events decreased gradually for the rest of the year.  Another obsevation from the graph is that the successful events in January and March are the same. 

Also from the above graph, failed events gradually increased from January until May. Between May and August, the events remained similiar. There is a spike of failed events in October.

- What are some limitations of this dataset? There is a summary of the limitations of the dataset.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? Is there a recommendation for additional tables or graphs?
