# Theater Play Outcomes in Relation to their Launch Dates and Funding Goals

## Overview of Project

### Louise’s play, Fever, came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. She wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. I used the Kickstarter dataset to analyze and visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. The following will be my analysis of how different the outcomes in relation to launch date and my analysis of how different the outcomes in relation to their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### The above graph provides information about theater outcomes in relation to the launch date. Based upon the above graph, after May, the number of successful events gradually decreased for the rest of the year.  

### Also from the above graph, the number of failed events gradually increased from January until May. Between May and August, the number of events remained similiar. There is a spike in the number of failed events in October. The amount of canceled events remained very low throughout the year.

### The above graph provides information about play outcomes based upon is pledged goal raised amount in dollars. Based upon the above graph, the percent of successful events gradually drecreased until the goal amount was $25,000. The percent of successful events increased from $25,000 to $44,999. After $45,000, the percent of successful events drop rapidly. The percent of failed events had the inverse information from the successful events.  

### How the graph is currently depicted, it is hard to compare postive and negative events without switching the data and graph to percentages when looking month to month. This information gives trend analysis of events that took place in a month. 

## Results

- May held largest difference between the most successful theater events compared to May failed theater events. Therefore, May would be the best time to launch a theater event. 

- The lowest difference in successful and failed theater events was held in December. Both successful and failed events were close to equal which would mean that a theater event held in December would have close to a 50% chance of success.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset? There is a summary of the limitations of the dataset.

- We should create another graph that is the percentages of theater outcomes based on launch date. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? Is there a recommendation for additional tables or graphs?
